# MealzOnboardingSwiftUI

This project is a SwiftUI demonstation implementation of [Mealz AI](https://en.mealz.ai/). 
The base app is a simple grocery store where users can add, update, & search for products. 

Over the course of many branches, seen at each step on the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/miamtech/MealzOnboardingSwiftUI/pulls), you can see the steps to implement Mealz. 
It begins with installation & initialization, then we gradually add the Mealz functionality. 

If you download the app & run it, you can enter anything to sign in or sign up. 
We do not store the users in a database, but just use the local session & local memory to determine if the user is classified as signed in or not. 

 This app is intended to be developed in tandem with our [Documentation](https://miamtech.github.io/mealz-documentation/).
